	<p>DoIt! supports several types of tasks:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Floating tasks: Tasks which have no time component.</li>
		<li>Deadline tasks: Tasks which have one time as deadline.</li>

	<h1><a name="UserInterface">User Interface</a></h1>

	<p>DoIt! user interface consist of forms: the agenda view and the list
	view.</p>

	<h2>Agenda View</h2>

	<p>The agenda view gives you an at-a-glance view of your tasks organised by
	date. It consists of two panes: the left pane shows your tasks that have a
	date (deadline and timed tasks) while the right pane shows your tasks with
	no date (floating tasks).</p>

	<p>The calendar allows you to quickly jump to your tasks on a particular
	day. Days that you have tasks are bolded.</p>

	<h2>List View</h2>

	<p>The list view lets you see all your tasks in a spreadsheet-like form.
	You can also perform actions like editing by double-clicking on the
	respective cell, as well as deleting your tasks by selecting the respective
	rows you want to delete and then pressing the "delete" button.</p>

	<h2>Toolbar</h2>

	<p>The toolbar at the top of DoIt's main window contains the following
	buttons:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Home</dt>

		<dd>Resets any search or list filters. Also (optionally) jumps to the
		default view (Agenda or List view) and jumps to today's tasks.
		Customize this in the settings.</dd>

		<dt>Undo</dt>

		<dd>Undo the last performed action.</dd>

		<dt>Agenda View/List View</dt>

		<dd>Switch to the selected view.</dd>

		<dt>Preferences</dt>

		<dd>Shows the preferences dialog.</dd>

		<dt>Help</dt>

		<dd>Shows this help dialog.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Command Box</h2>

	<p>Use the command box right at the bottom of the window to perform all
	sorts of operations on your tasks list. Type in the command you want and
	press Enter to execute the command. The status of the command will be shown
	in the space below.</p>
	
	<h2>Quick Add Box</h2>
